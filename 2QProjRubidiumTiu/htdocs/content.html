        </header>

        <section class="text">
            Fear is the greatest motivator, right? Nothing quite influences our actions like fear does. Prison scares us so we abide by the law. We send people to jail as punishment for their crimes, and so they don’t repeat their mistakes.
            <br><br>
            Right?
            <br><br>
            But is it true that punishment is the most effective way of reducing criminality? Even further, is punishment just and fair in response to criminality, when criminality is an inevitability due to the way our society is currently structured?
            <br><br>
            Supposedly, imprisonment is intended to be a mix of both punishment and rehabilitation. The intended end result is for an ex-convict to never want to be incarcerated again. This relates to a very important term in criminal justice—recidivism. This is the tendency of an offender to relapse back into criminal behaviour, or reoffend. Rates of repeat offending are used to analyse how effective prison systems are among different countries.
            <br><br> 
            Of course, it’s widely known that most prison systems around the world tend to skew more towards the punishment side of things rather than rehabilitation, especially third world countries who have less funding for programs and infrastructure. Even mainstream society likes the idea of punishment more than rehabilitation, as this is viewed as justice—an eye for an eye, right?

        <section class="text">
            Recidivism rates around the world, however, disagree with this notion. Interestingly, the country with the lowest recidivism rates in the world is Norway, at 20% of their inmate population reoffending. Comparatively, the U.S. has recidivism rates of 76.6%: one of the highest. (Hurray for the prison-industrial complex!) This means that in Norway, convicts tend to stay out of jail once they’re released. More than that, the country saw a 40% increase in employment rates among their released prisoners that were jobless before their incarceration. Norway accredited these statistics to restorative justice and an empathetic outlook towards criminals. Crime is just as much societal failing as it is personal failing, and has more to do with personal upbringing and your environment than anything else. Instead of pushing fear and punishment on offenders, their justice system strives to rehabilitate them in hopes of them reintegrating into society and contributing to their community once they’re released. Their prison system provides educational and vocational programs to all inmates, and is structured so that their facilities don’t resemble cages. Bars are prohibited in many of Norway’s prisons, and most provide amenities that would seem luxurious in most other countries, like personal showers and televisions. You don’t want inmates to act like animals, so don’t treat them like they are.
            <br><br>
            If we want inmates to be helpful, contributing members of society, we need to equip them with the skills and knowledge they need to reintegrate back into their communities. We can’t just toss them into a cage with 70 other people and expect that they turn out fine once they come back out. Often we forget that these are human beings, and that under different circumstances, we could've ended up in the same place they’re in right now.
